# Release Templates

Use these files for each Launcharr release:

- Announcement draft: `docs/release/announcement-template.md`
- Changelog draft: `docs/release/changelog-template.md`
- Historical notes (v0.1.0 -> v0.2.5): `docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md`

Suggested workflow:

1. Copy both templates for the new version.
2. Fill in exact version/date and changes.
3. Validate against `docs/wiki/Release-Checklist.md`.
4. Publish changelog and announcement together.
