# Changelog

## [v0.2.34] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- None.

### Changed

- Updated Romm `Recently Added` client sorting so Launcharr explicitly orders items by newest timestamp first.
- Aligned Romm `Recently Added` ordering behavior between Dashboard and App Overview cards (both use the same deterministic newest-first path).

### Fixed

- Fixed mismatch where Romm `Recently Added` could appear in different order between Dashboard and App Overview.
- Fixed cases where upstream response order produced stale-looking `Recently Added` cards in Launcharr.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No schema/data migration required.
- Browser hard refresh is recommended after upgrade so updated `romm-overview.js` is loaded.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Open Romm `Recently Added` on Dashboard and capture the first 10 items.
- [ ] Open Romm `Recently Added` on App Overview and confirm the same ordering.
- [ ] Confirm newest items are shown first after a hard refresh.
