# Launcharr v0.2.11

## [v0.2.11] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- Added release artifact files for `v0.2.11`:
  - `docs/release/releases/v0.2.11.md`
  - `docs/release/releases/v0.2.11-announcement.md`
- Added a `v0.2.11` entry in `docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

### Changed

- Updated package version metadata to `0.2.11`.
- Updated release timeline header in `RELEASE_NOTES.md` to include `v0.2.11`.
- Updated `v0.2.9` and `v0.2.10` release docs/announcements to reflect corrected base URL feature ownership.

### Fixed

- Fixed release attribution so base URL/subpath support is documented under `v0.2.10`, not `v0.2.9`.
- Fixed cross-file release-note consistency between per-release files and top-level timeline notes.

### Migration Notes

- No schema/config migration required for `v0.2.11`.
- No runtime configuration changes are required for existing deployments.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] `docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md` includes populated `Added/Changed/Fixed` items for `v0.2.11`.
- [ ] Base URL/subpath notes appear under `v0.2.10` docs, not `v0.2.9`.
