# Launcharr v0.2.7 Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.7` is now available.

## Short Summary

This release adds first-class `qBittorrent` and `SABnzbd` support, improves combined downloader management, and fixes key release/settings workflow issues.

## What's New

- Added `qBittorrent` and `SABnzbd` as default downloader apps with icon support.
- Added downloader queue API + card rendering support for both apps (single and combined queue cards).
- Updated Combined Download Queue source selection to match the same card-style source selector used in other combined cards.
- Fixed missing Prowlarr API key field in both app settings entry points.

## Why It Matters

- Admins can now manage all common downloader stacks in one place (Transmission, NZBGet, qBittorrent, SABnzbd).
- Combined queue cards are more consistent and easier to configure.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.7`
- Optional tags depending on your release choices: `development` and/or `latest`
- No data migration required.
- Ensure credentials are set:
  - qBittorrent: username/password
  - SABnzbd: API key
