# Changelog

## [v0.2.33] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Added a new `About` tab in `Settings` with Launcharr build/context details, support links, and release history.
- Added release rows in `Settings -> About` with a `View Changelog` action and modal summary that links to the full GitHub release notes.
- Added role-based sidebar app-button press actions in `Settings -> General` for both `Short Press` and `Long Press`:
  - `Default`
  - `Launch`
  - `App settings`
  - `Activity`
- Added new `About` icon asset for the settings tab (`public/icons/about.svg`).

### Changed

- Renamed the settings tab label from `Log` to `Logs` for consistency with the page content.
- Changed sidebar app-button press action controls to filter-button popover selectors and moved the section to the bottom of General settings (above save).
- Updated sidebar press-action layout/spacing for improved compactness and mobile fit.
- Updated role-press settings copy to clarify behavior when sidebar submenu links are hidden.

### Fixed

- Fixed settings release modal layering/positioning issues by moving the modal backdrop outside tab-panel stacking contexts and centering it correctly.
- Fixed sidebar press-action launch behavior so apps configured for `new-tab` open in a new tab instead of the current window.
- Fixed press-action routing in sidebar and app/info pages (`Dashboard`, `App Overview`, `App Launch`, `App Settings`, `App Activity`, `User Settings`, and `Settings`) to consistently honor launch mode metadata.
- Fixed hidden-link interaction: when `Hide App settings link in sidebar` or `Hide Activity link in sidebar` is enabled, configured short/long press actions can still open those destinations.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- Removed inline selected-value text beside General press-action filter buttons to improve compact mobile layout.

### Migration Notes

- No schema/data migration required.
- Existing installs will persist new role press-action preferences under `general.sidebarButtonPressActions`.
- Legacy fallback fields remain compatible (`sidebarButtonShortPressAction`, `sidebarButtonLongPressAction`).

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] In `Settings -> General`, configure role-based short/long press actions and save.
- [ ] Verify `Launch` press action respects each app launch mode (`new-tab` vs `iframe`) from both dashboard and app/info pages.
- [ ] Enable `Hide App settings link in sidebar` and verify `App settings` press action still opens `/apps/:id/settings`.
- [ ] Enable `Hide Activity link in sidebar` and verify `Activity` press action still opens `/apps/:id/activity`.
- [ ] Open `Settings -> About`, click `View Changelog`, confirm centered modal, summary bullets, and working `Full Release` link.
