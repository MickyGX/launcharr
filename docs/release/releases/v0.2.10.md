# Launcharr v0.2.10

## [v0.2.10] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- Added dedicated Launcharr `Base URL Path` setting in `Settings -> General -> Server Identity`.
- Added `general.basePath` support in config resolution and save flow.
- Added base-path normalization helpers to safely handle values like:
  - `/launcharr`
  - `launcharr`
  - full URL input where only path is needed

### Changed

- Updated Launcharr public URL resolution so callback/forward URLs apply configured base path.
- Updated app/downloader/ARR/Prowlarr/Pulsarr/Seerr/Jellyfin/Emby URL joining to preserve path prefixes in configured app URLs.
- Updated Plex auth view callback and PIN storage request URL generation to be base-path aware.

### Fixed

- Fixed path-stripping behavior that previously reduced configured URLs to origin-only in several integration paths.
- Fixed proxy/API routing joins that broke apps deployed under subpaths (for example `https://host/radarr`).
- Fixed release attribution: base URL support is now documented under `v0.2.10` instead of `v0.2.9`.

### Migration Notes

- No schema migration required.
- If Launcharr is hosted behind a reverse-proxy subpath, set `Base URL Path` in General Settings (for example `/launcharr`).
- Existing root-path deployments require no configuration change.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] `Settings -> General` displays `Base URL Path`.
- [ ] Saving `Base URL Path` persists value in config and survives restart.
- [ ] Plex login callback uses Launcharr base path correctly.
- [ ] App integrations continue working when app URLs include path prefixes.
- [ ] Root-path deployments (`/`) continue working unchanged.
