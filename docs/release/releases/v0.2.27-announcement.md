# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.27` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.27` improves Seerr/Overseerr request reliability by preferring configured URLs and avoiding incorrect localhost fallback attempts.

## What's New

- Seerr/Pulsarr request modules now prioritize explicit `remoteUrl` and `localUrl` values for API calls.
- Loopback fallback URLs (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) are now skipped when non-loopback URLs are configured.
- Seerr request failures now report all attempted upstream base URLs to speed up troubleshooting.

## Why It Matters

- Prevents false/misleading `ECONNREFUSED` errors against `localhost` when your real service URL is configured.
- Makes request-module connectivity behavior predictable across local and remote setups.
- Improves troubleshooting signal when upstream services are unreachable.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.27`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (no `latest` tag for this release path).
- No schema/data migration required.
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade to apply request URL candidate logic changes.
