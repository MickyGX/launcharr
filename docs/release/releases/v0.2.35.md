# Changelog

## [v0.2.35] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Added first-class Maintainerr integration as a default app (`Arr Suite`) with Overview + Launch + Admin settings access model.
- Added Maintainerr overview modules on Dashboard and App Overview:
  - `Library Media`
  - `Rules` (with execute action)
  - `Collections Media`
- Added Maintainerr API adapters for library media, rules, collections media, rule execution, and TMDB poster/backdrop proxy routes.
- Added Maintainerr documentation entries to supported app and integration wiki tables.

### Changed

- Updated Maintainerr cards to align with Launcharr card styling and controls (filters, carousel navigation, collapse behavior).
- Updated Maintainerr fallback artwork rendering logic for rule/media cards, including improved placeholder handling and icon sizing behavior.
- Updated Maintainerr rules card face to show streamlined metadata (`Last run`) and removed rule-card view popup trigger.
- Updated asset versioning behavior to use runtime build-scoped cache keys, reducing stale JS/CSS after upgrades/rebuilds.
- Updated app views to use versioned static asset URLs for `styles.css`, `version-badge.js`, and `pwa.js`.

### Fixed

- Fixed Maintainerr artwork resolution paths where library/placeholder poster sources could render incorrectly.
- Fixed Maintainerr rules/collections card visual regressions (pill/icon/button alignment, fallback icon clipping, text wrapping/truncation).
- Fixed long-press fallback behavior on touch devices for sidebar app buttons when Pointer Events are unavailable.
- Fixed local-network iframe launch host mismatch by normalizing iframe target host to the active Launcharr host for local/private IP pairs.
- Fixed local Romm iframe login-loop scenario in mixed-LAN-host access patterns (example: Launcharr opened on `192.168.0.39` while app URL used `192.168.0.2`).

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No schema/data migration required.
- Browser hard refresh is recommended after upgrade so cache-busted assets are reloaded.
- For LAN iframe launches, use consistent hostnames/IPs across Launcharr and app local URLs where possible.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Maintainerr appears in app list with correct icon/category defaults.
- [ ] Maintainerr `Library Media`, `Rules`, and `Collections Media` modules render on Dashboard and App Overview.
- [ ] Maintainerr rule execute action works from card action button.
- [ ] Maintainerr fallback artwork displays correctly (no stretched/thin icon artifacts).
- [ ] Sidebar short/long press behavior works on desktop and touch clients.
- [ ] Romm iframe launch via LAN IP no longer loops login when Launcharr is accessed from a different local IP host.
