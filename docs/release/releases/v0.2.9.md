## [v0.2.9] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- Added release artifact files for `v0.2.9`:
  - `docs/release/releases/v0.2.9.md`
  - `docs/release/releases/v0.2.9-announcement.md`
- Added a `v0.2.9` section in `docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

### Changed

- Standardized release-note placeholders/content alignment for the `v0.2.9` release cycle.

### Fixed

- Corrected release timeline consistency around `v0.2.9` artifacts.

### Migration Notes

- No schema/config migration required for `v0.2.9`.
- If you are looking for base URL support changes, use `v0.2.10` notes.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] `package.json` reports `0.2.9` for this release.
- [ ] `docs/release/releases/v0.2.9.md` and `docs/release/releases/v0.2.9-announcement.md` exist and match this scope.
- [ ] `RELEASE_NOTES.md` separates `v0.2.9` (release bookkeeping) from `v0.2.10` (base URL changes).
