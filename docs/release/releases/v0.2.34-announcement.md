# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.34` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.34` is a targeted Romm patch release that fixes `Recently Added` ordering consistency between Dashboard and App Overview.

## What's New

- Fixed Romm `Recently Added` ordering mismatch between Launcharr Dashboard and Overview cards.
- Updated Romm card sorting to consistently prioritize newest entries first.

## Why It Matters

- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (no `latest` tag for this release path).
- No migration steps required. Hard refresh browser assets after upgrade.
