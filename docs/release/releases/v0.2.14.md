# Launcharr v0.2.14

## [v0.2.14] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Added queue pagination controls to table-based queue modules for:
  - ARR queue cards (`Radarr`, `Sonarr`, `Lidarr`, `Readarr`)
  - downloader queue cards (`Transmission`, `qBittorrent`, `NZBGet`, `SABnzbd`)
  - combined queue cards (ARR combined + downloader combined)
- Added active sort-direction indicators on queue table headers (`↑` / `↓`) with current-column highlighting.
- Added `Visible items in queue` input to all table-card settings dropdowns so table cards can control row density consistently.
- Added `Jackett` and `Autobrr` as major default app integrations with release-ready icon coverage.
- Added/expanded overview/dashboard card support paths for `Jackett` search workflows and `Autobrr` queue/match workflows.

### Changed

- Standardized queue table presentation to match the newer table card format (header/body spacing, row styling, footer pagination placement).
- Updated Prowlarr/Jackett search cards to use numeric pagination controls instead of top-bar previous/next arrow paging.
- Updated table settings labeling/mapping so column controls align more closely with rendered table columns.
- Updated queue rendering flow to apply sorting/filtering before page slicing, keeping pagination consistent with active filters.

### Fixed

- Fixed recurring queue/table formatting drift between app overview and dashboard cards.
- Fixed multiple mobile regressions in table modules and settings instance button rendering.
- Fixed Prowlarr filter interaction regressions around indexer/category selection behavior.
- Fixed app settings submenu regression where `App settings` link could disappear after remove/re-add workflows.
- Fixed startup failure regression from malformed expression syntax in `src/index.js`.

### Migration Notes

- No schema/data migration required.
- Existing queue display preferences remain compatible; new table-card row-limit fields default safely when unset.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] ARR queue cards paginate correctly on dashboard and app overview pages.
- [ ] Downloader queue cards paginate correctly for standalone and combined cards.
- [ ] Queue sort headers show correct active direction arrow after sort changes.
- [ ] `Visible items in queue` appears in settings dropdowns for all table cards and persists after save.
- [ ] Prowlarr/Jackett search uses numeric pagination and no longer shows top-bar prev/next page arrows.
- [ ] Mobile layout for queue/table cards and app settings instance controls remains intact.
