# Changelog

## [v0.2.23] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added `Base URL Path` back to `Settings -> General -> Server Identity` so Launcharr can be hosted under a subpath (for example `/launcharr`).
- Added `general.basePath` to general settings defaults/example config and save flow.

### Changed

- Updated Launcharr public callback URL generation to apply configured base path for Plex auth redirect/forward URLs.
- Updated app API/proxy URL joins to preserve configured subpaths for integrations (for example `https://domain.com/app`).
- Updated sidebar brand menu quick actions:
  - Starfield label now toggles between `Enable Starfield` / `Disable Starfield`.
  - Maximized-state label now reads `Minimise window`.
  - Option typography tightened so menu options fit on one line.

### Fixed

- Fixed subpath regressions where absolute URL joins could drop app path prefixes across ARR, downloader, and media-service integrations.
- Fixed starfield behavior so it is force-disabled on mobile and maximized view, with automatic restore to prior user state when minimized.
- Fixed starfield quick-menu control state by greying/locking it when starfield is unavailable in mobile/maximized modes.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No data migration required.
- If Launcharr is served behind a reverse-proxy subpath, set `Settings -> General -> Base URL Path` (for example `/launcharr`).
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade so updated client/server assets are loaded.
