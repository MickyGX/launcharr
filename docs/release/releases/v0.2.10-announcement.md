# Launcharr v0.2.10 Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.10` is now available.

## Short Summary

This release delivers Launcharr + app base URL/subpath support and moves those notes out of `v0.2.9` into their correct release.

## What's New

- Added a dedicated `Base URL Path` setting under `Settings -> General`.
- Updated Launcharr callback/public URL generation to respect configured base path.
- Updated integration URL joins so app paths like `/radarr`, `/prowlarr`, and `/launcharr` are preserved.
- Corrected release documentation attribution: base URL work is now tracked in `v0.2.10`.

## Why It Matters

- Reverse-proxy subpath deployments are now configurable in-app.
- App integrations are more reliable when services are hosted under URL prefixes.
- Release history is now accurate across `v0.2.9` and `v0.2.10`.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.10`
- No schema migration required.
- Set `Base URL Path` after upgrade if Launcharr is served under a subpath.

## Documentation

- Release notes: `docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md`
- Changelog: `docs/release/releases/v0.2.10.md`
- Prior release: `docs/release/releases/v0.2.9.md`

## Known Issues

- None noted for `v0.2.10`.

## Call to Action

Upgrade to `v0.2.10`, set `Base URL Path` if needed, and validate Plex/app integrations under your proxy path layout.
