# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.26` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.26` separates dashboard-card visibility from app-overview visibility, giving admins explicit control over each surface.

## What's New

- `Settings -> Custom -> Dashboard` visibility popover now includes a dedicated `Overview` role selector.
- Visibility popup order is now `Overview` first, then `Dashboard`.
- Dashboard-managed element settings now persist `overviewVisibilityRole` separately from `dashboardVisibilityRole`.
- App overview access checks now honor the dedicated overview visibility role.

## Why It Matters

- You can expose cards on dashboard and app overview independently per role.
- Visibility intent is clearer in UI and easier to reason about.
- Existing installs keep working through backward-compatible fallback handling.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.26`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (no `latest` tag for this release path).
- No schema/data migration required.
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade to apply updated server/template visibility logic.
