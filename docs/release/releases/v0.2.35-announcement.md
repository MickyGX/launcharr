# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.35` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.35` delivers full Maintainerr integration, improves touch/sidebar action reliability, and fixes LAN iframe login-loop edge cases.

## What's New

- Added Maintainerr as a default integrated app with Launcharr-native overview cards (`Library Media`, `Rules`, `Collections Media`).
- Added Maintainerr rule execution support directly from overview cards.
- Improved Maintainerr card styling/fallback artwork handling and streamlined rule card metadata.
- Fixed LAN iframe host mismatch behavior that could trigger app login loops (including Romm scenarios).
- Hardened static asset cache-busting across app views to reduce stale frontend behavior after upgrades.

## Why It Matters

- Maintainerr now feels like a first-class Launcharr module instead of a plain link-out app.
- Card rendering and touch interactions are more consistent across desktop/mobile clients.
- Local-IP iframe launches are more reliable in real-world multi-host LAN access setups.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.35`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (if selected during release flow).
- No migration steps required. Hard refresh browser assets after upgrade.

## Documentation

- Changelog: `docs/release/releases/v0.2.35.md`
- Release timeline: `docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md`
- Supported apps: `docs/wiki/Supported-Apps.md`

## Known Issues

- Some strict browser privacy/cookie policies may still affect third-party iframe sessions depending on upstream app cookie settings.
