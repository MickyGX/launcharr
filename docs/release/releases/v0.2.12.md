# Launcharr v0.2.12

## [v0.2.12] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- Added `general.basePath` handling in runtime config and settings save flow.
- Added request-aware base-path middleware to:
  - strip prefixed request paths safely
  - patch redirects with base-path prefixes
  - patch rendered HTML output for root-relative links/assets
- Added a client base-path patch script for `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, and URL-bearing DOM attributes.
- Added authenticated Jellyfin image proxy endpoint: `/api/jellyfin/image`.
- Added dashboard-style filter popover controls to app overview card top bars (replacing per-card dropdown UX).

### Changed

- Updated PWA path handling for subpath installs:
  - `manifest.webmanifest` now uses relative `start_url`, `scope`, and icon paths
  - `public/pwa.js` now registers service worker with base-path-aware URL/scope
  - `public/sw.js` now scopes cache keys/assets by registration scope path
- Updated Jellyfin active/recent artwork resolution to use stronger image fallbacks (item/series/parent refs).
- Updated Jellyfin card/modal rendering to fall back between poster and backdrop when one is missing.
- Updated overview filter icon sync to include source filters consistently.
- Reduced Plex watchlisted card background hydration calls to improve UI responsiveness.
- Updated admin-view detection in `version-badge.js` for more robust switch-view link matching.

### Fixed

- Fixed missing Jellyfin artwork in Recently Added cards.
- Fixed missing Jellyfin modal poster/background artwork fallback behavior.
- Fixed overview-page control mismatch so individual app cards can use the same filter-button pattern as dashboard cards.
- Fixed icon/filter asset path behavior in subpath/reverse-proxy deployments.
- Fixed base-path propagation for redirects, rendered links/assets, and Plex callback forwarding.

### Migration Notes

- No schema migration required.
- For reverse-proxy subpath hosting, set `Settings -> General -> Base URL Path` (for example `/launcharr`).
- Root-path deployments require no additional configuration.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] App pages, auth redirects, and asset links work from both root (`/`) and configured subpath.
- [ ] Service worker registers successfully with the expected scope in subpath deployments.
- [ ] Overview cards show filter popover button UI instead of top-bar dropdown controls.
- [ ] Jellyfin Recently Added cards render posters and modal view renders artwork background/poster reliably.
- [ ] Version badge still appears only in admin view.
