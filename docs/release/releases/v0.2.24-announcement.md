# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.24` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.24` delivers Transmission multi-instance support and generalizes instance handling so additional app families can be rolled out with consistent behavior.

## What's New

- Transmission now supports multiple instances end-to-end, including settings, dashboard queue cards, and app overview queue cards.
- Multi-instance behavior now reads app metadata (`supportsInstances`, limits, placeholders) instead of relying on hardcoded app lists.
- Settings now correctly show downloader credentials for additional instances, and overview queue modules no longer throw server errors for instance IDs.

## Why It Matters

- Admins can split downloader/ARR workloads across multiple instances with predictable configuration controls.
- Users get stable dashboard/overview queue behavior even when apps are configured as `*-2`, `*-3`, and so on.
- Operators get a reusable rollout path for multi-instance support across more integrations.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.24`
