# Changelog

## [v0.2.18] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- None.

### Changed

- Built-in app remove/re-add flows now work independently from strict default-catalog membership.
- Settings now enables built-in removal actions only for built-in primary apps.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/settings/default-apps/remove` validation to check built-in app eligibility instead of catalog presence.
- Fixed Settings fallback app recovery so removed built-in apps missing from the catalog can still be re-added.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No data migration required.
