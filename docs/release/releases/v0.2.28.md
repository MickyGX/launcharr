# Changelog

## [v0.2.28] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added explicit base-app API-key detection list for settings rendering, including Seerr and Pulsarr.

### Changed

- Updated API key field visibility logic in both app settings views to use base app IDs rather than category-only checks.
- Updated settings status evaluation to align with the explicit API-key-required app list.

### Fixed

- Fixed regression where the Seerr API key input could be hidden in Launcharr settings.
- Fixed inconsistent API-key input visibility between `Settings -> App` and the per-app settings page.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No schema migration required.
- Existing app credentials remain compatible.
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade to apply template updates.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] In `Settings -> App -> Seerr`, the API key field is visible
- [ ] In per-app settings (`/apps/seerr/settings`), the API key field is visible
- [ ] Saving Seerr API key updates request-module access behavior as expected
