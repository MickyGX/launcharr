# Changelog

## [v0.2.31] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Added a first-install `Quick Start Guide` popup (admin view) with setup steps and a direct link to `Settings -> Custom -> Sidebar`.
- Added a version `Welcome` popup that shows release highlights from `Added/Changed/Fixed` sections in release notes and links to GitHub release notes.
- Added unified custom cards for `Arr Suite` and `Downloaders`, following the same unified-source model as media cards.
- Added unified-card source controls so one card can target one or many apps per module, instead of requiring separate individual/combined card types.
- Added a default `Requesters` category and icon support, with `Pulsarr` and `Seerr` now grouped under `Requesters`.
- Added first-run config bootstrap from `config.example.json` when `/app/config/config.json` is missing, so onboarding defaults are applied.

### Changed

- Changed fresh-install defaults so built-in apps start in a removed state until explicitly restored from `Settings -> Custom -> Sidebar`.
- Changed dashboard filter/visibility UX so unified cards support per-app `Overview` visibility and card-level `Dashboard` visibility in popovers.
- Changed Tautulli watch statistics to a single card with a filter-selectable `list` or `wheel` view mode.
- Changed dashboard manager add-item ordering and grouping to better align with default category priority and migration intent.
- Changed popup styling to a darker, higher-contrast modal treatment that better matches Launcharr's theme.

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated/legacy app cards being reintroduced during default app restore/add flows.
- Fixed dashboard render ordering mismatches versus dashboard manager order with more deterministic ordering fallback.
- Fixed unified ARR/Downloader icon selection so single-source cards use app-specific icon context consistently.
- Fixed Romm `Recently Added` ordering/artwork mapping and added Romm icon fallback artwork when an item has no media art.
- Fixed migration of legacy Tautulli `watch-stats-wheel` configurations into unified watch statistics view settings.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- Legacy app-specific and legacy combined dashboard cards remain deprecated and are excluded from forward-path add flows.

### Removed

- Removed standalone default `watch-stats-wheel` card entry in favor of unified Tautulli watch statistics configuration.

### Migration Notes

- Existing installs keep their current `config/config.json`; only first-run bootstraps copy from `config.example.json`.
- Existing Tautulli wheel/list split entries are migrated to unified `watch-stats` with persisted `tautulliStatsView`.
- Existing deprecated cards are preserved if already configured, but no longer part of default add workflows.
- Unified-card migration path: use new unified cards for Media/ARR/Downloaders going forward; legacy combined/app-specific variants remain for compatibility only.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] On first install, `Quick Start Guide` appears once in admin view and links to `Settings -> Custom -> Sidebar`.

- [ ] New unified ARR/Downloader cards can be added and configured via filter popovers with per-source selection.
