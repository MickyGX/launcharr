# Changelog

## [v0.2.29] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added Romm as a built-in `Games` integration with overview modules for `Recently Added` and `Consoles`.
- Added Romm console controls for sort/filter behavior (`Most ROMs`, `A to Z`, `Z to A`, `Least ROMs`) plus `All` limit.
- Added theme persistence actions for both admin defaults (`/settings/theme-defaults`) and user profile preferences (`/user-settings/theme`).

### Changed

- Updated Romm dashboard/app-overview rendering to use Plex-style carousel cards with eye-icon detail popups.
- Updated Romm console artwork mapping with broader asset candidate detection and slug-based platform artwork fallbacks.
- Updated integration documentation to include the full built-in app catalog (including Romm).

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate date rendering on Romm `Recently Added` cards.
- Fixed Romm console ROM count parsing (previously returning `0` for some payload shapes).
- Fixed Romm console popup fallback content by generating stats summaries when overview text is missing.
- Removed Romm API key input from app settings UI where it is not required for standard Romm setup.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- Restart Launcharr after upgrade to apply the updated Romm overview assets and settings forms.
