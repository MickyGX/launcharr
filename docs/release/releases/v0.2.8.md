# Launcharr v0.2.8

## [v0.2.8] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- Added a single per-app filter control in `Settings -> Custom -> Sidebar` with role-based access for:
  - Sidebar
  - Overview
  - Launch
  - App settings
  - Activity
- Added per-card role visibility filter controls in `Settings -> Custom -> Dashboard`.
- Added category-level role visibility controls in `Settings -> Custom -> Categories`.
- Added default category remove/re-add management with icon-aware dropdown selection.
- Added sidebar header quick-menu options for:
  - Starfield on/off
  - Maximize/minimize layout within the browser window
- Added mobile behavior to hide the sidebar header quick menu where space is constrained.

### Changed

- Updated manager and dashboard filter UX to use consistent filter-button popovers.
- Updated maximize mode handling to persist across navigation without temporary layout collapse.
- Updated category behavior so apps remain visible (not incorrectly hidden) when a category is restricted for a given role.
- Updated release runtime guidance to use `dockuser:everyone` for container user/group where applicable.

### Fixed

- Fixed a settings-page JavaScript syntax regression that caused manager actions (add/remove/edit) to fail.
- Fixed dashboard manager dropdown click-through where selecting filter options could trigger controls underneath.
- Fixed combined downloader re-add label mismatch (`Combined Activity Queue` -> `Combined Download Queue`).
- Fixed `NZBGet` icon rendering fallback in download queue headers/cards.
- Fixed maximize mode flicker on navigation in settings/dashboard/app views.

### Migration Notes

- No schema migration required.
- If you use Docker Compose with user/group mapping, set:
  - `user: "dockuser:everyone"`
- Re-check role visibility in:
  - `Settings -> Custom -> Sidebar`
  - `Settings -> Custom -> Dashboard`
  - `Settings -> Custom -> Categories`
  especially if you previously relied on simple enabled/disabled behavior.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] App sidebar filter popup saves role levels for Sidebar/Overview/Launch/App settings/Activity.
- [ ] Dashboard card filter popup saves and applies per-card visibility levels.
- [ ] Category visibility roles hide/show category grouping correctly by user role.
- [ ] Removed default categories can be re-added from the dropdown with the correct icon.
- [ ] Maximize mode stays active across internal navigation and does not flash back to boxed layout.
- [ ] NZBGet icon appears correctly on download queue modules.
