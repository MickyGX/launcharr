# Changelog

## [v0.2.24] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added Transmission multi-instance support across settings, dashboard queue cards, and app overview queue cards.
- Added metadata-driven multi-instance fields in default app definitions:
  - `supportsInstances`
  - `maxInstances`
  - `instanceNamePlaceholder`
- Added dynamic multi-instance maps passed from server to settings templates for instance base IDs, titles, limits, and placeholder text.

### Changed

- Replaced hardcoded multi-instance app detection with runtime metadata-driven detection while retaining legacy fallback compatibility.
- Updated downloader queue API handling to support instance app IDs (for example `transmission-2`) and resolve behavior by base app type.
- Updated template app-base resolution to only match canonical IDs (`base` or `base-<number>`) to avoid false base-id matches.
- Updated downloader queue client-side mapping to normalize instance IDs for downloader-specific queue rendering logic.

### Fixed

- Fixed missing downloader credential fields (username/password) for additional instances in settings views.
- Fixed app overview server error for downloader instances caused by undefined base-resolution usage.
- Fixed downloader queue card classification and labels when using instance IDs.
- Fixed app icon/status token logic in app settings for instance-backed app IDs.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No data/schema migration required.
- Existing single-instance setups continue working without config changes.
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade so updated server/template/client code is loaded.
