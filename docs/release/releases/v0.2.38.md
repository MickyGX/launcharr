# Changelog

## [v0.2.38] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- None.

### Changed

- Reverted Romm admin launch auto-bootstrap/injected-credential behavior to the standard Romm admin launch path.
- Kept Romm viewer/co-admin shared viewer launch bootstrap flow unchanged.
- Kept `Test Admin Session` and `Test Viewer Session` tools available in Romm settings for diagnostics/manual session priming.

### Fixed

- Fixed regression where Romm admin launches could fall back out of iframe/new-tab behavior unexpectedly when admin session bootstrap failed (for example 401 on a local URL candidate) even though iframe mode was configured.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- Removed automatic Romm admin launch credential injection/bootstrap from the default admin launch path (diagnostic/test tooling remains).

### Migration Notes

- No schema/data migration required.
- Browser hard refresh is recommended after upgrade so updated launch/settings scripts are loaded.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Romm `admin` launch follows configured Launch Mode (`iframe` or `new-tab`) without being forced to top-level fallback due to admin bootstrap failure.
- [ ] Romm `user` / `co-admin` viewer launch still uses the viewer-session bootstrap flow.
- [ ] `Test Admin Session` still runs and reports success/failure diagnostics using the main Romm Username/Password fields.
- [ ] `Test Viewer Session` still runs and reports success/failure diagnostics using the viewer fields.
