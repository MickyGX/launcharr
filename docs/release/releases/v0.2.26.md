# Changelog

## [v0.2.26] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added separate `Overview` visibility control for dashboard elements in:
  - `Settings -> Custom -> Dashboard -> Visibility` popover
- Added `overviewVisibilityRole` persistence for app overview elements, independent from `dashboardVisibilityRole`.

### Changed

- Updated dashboard visibility popup order so `Overview` appears above `Dashboard`.
- Updated dashboard settings save flow to persist both visibility roles per element:
  - `..._overview_visibility_role`
  - `..._visibility_role` (dashboard)
- Updated app overview element access evaluation to use the dedicated overview visibility role.

### Fixed

- Fixed coupling where dashboard visibility could implicitly control overview visibility for dashboard-managed element settings.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No schema migration required.
- Existing element visibility settings remain backward compatible:
  - If `overviewVisibilityRole` is missing, Launcharr falls back to existing dashboard visibility or menu defaults.
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade to apply server/template logic updates.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] In `Settings -> Custom -> Dashboard`, visibility popup shows `Overview` above `Dashboard`
- [ ] Changing `Overview` role does not automatically change `Dashboard` role
- [ ] Changing `Dashboard` role does not automatically change `Overview` role
- [ ] App overview cards respect `Overview` visibility role by user role (`admin`, `co-admin`, `user`, `guest`)
- [ ] Dashboard cards respect `Dashboard` visibility role independently
- [ ] Existing apps without explicit overview role still resolve visibility correctly
