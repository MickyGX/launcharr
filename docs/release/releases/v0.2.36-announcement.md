# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.36` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.36` is a small UX/settings patch that adds a `Hide scrollbars` theme option and updates the About-page Discord support link.

## What's New

- Added a `Hide scrollbars` theme option (visual only; scrolling still works).
- Added support for saving `Hide scrollbars` in admin theme defaults and user theme preferences.
- Updated the About page Discord link to the current invite.

## Why It Matters

- Cleaner UI on Windows and other environments that show prominent scrollbar rails.
- Theme behavior is now more consistent across admin defaults and user overrides.
- Support links stay current from inside Launcharr.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.36`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (if selected during release flow).
- No migration steps required. Hard refresh browser assets after upgrade.

## Documentation

- Release timeline: `docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md`

## Known Issues
