# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.31` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.31` expands unified dashboard cards to ARR + Downloaders, introduces first-run and release popups for onboarding/update clarity, and tightens deprecated-card migration behavior.

## What's New

- Added first-install `Quick Start Guide` popup with guided setup steps and direct sidebar-settings navigation.
- Added a release `Welcome` popup that highlights the main `Added/Changed/Fixed` changes for the installed version.
- Added unified custom cards for ARR and Downloaders to match media unified-card workflows.
- Added unified-card source selection so each unified card can represent either a single app source or multiple app sources.
- Added a new `Requesters` default category and moved `Pulsarr`/`Seerr` defaults into it.
- Unified Tautulli watch statistics into one card with selectable `list` or `wheel` display mode.

## Why It Matters

- Setup is clearer on new installs, with less guesswork for first app and card configuration.
- Version upgrades now surface the key changes immediately in-app.
- Unified cards reduce duplicate card types and simplify source selection across Media, ARR, and Downloaders.
- Deprecated-card behavior is safer during migration, reducing accidental reintroduction of legacy cards.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.31`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (no `latest` tag for this release path).
- Existing configs are preserved; first-run bootstrapping from `config.example.json` only applies when no config exists.
- Existing legacy/deprecated cards are preserved if already present, but excluded from default add flows.
