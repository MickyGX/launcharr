# Launcharr v0.2.14 Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.14` is now available.

## Short Summary

This release focuses on table stability and consistency: queue/activity card pagination, sortable header arrows, unified table formatting, and broader table-card settings control.

## What's New

- Added numeric pagination to queue-based table cards across ARR and downloader modules (including combined cards).
- Added visible sort arrows (`↑` / `↓`) for queue table headers with active-column state.
- Added `Visible items in queue` settings support across all table-card dropdown configurations.
- Updated queue table styling to align ARR/downloader/combined cards to one consistent format.
- Updated Prowlarr/Jackett search to numeric pagination controls and removed top-bar page arrows.
- Added `Jackett` and `Autobrr` as major default app integrations with overview/dashboard card support.

## Why It Matters

- Operators get predictable, consistent table behavior across all queue/activity-style cards.
- Pagination and row-density controls make large queues easier to scan and manage.
- Shared styling and sort indicators reduce recurring UI regressions between dashboard and app overview pages.
- Mobile behavior is more stable for table-heavy cards and settings controls.
- Native `Jackett` and `Autobrr` defaults reduce custom setup work for common downloader/indexer stacks.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.14`
- No schema migration required.
- After upgrade, review `Settings -> Dashboard` table-card options if you want to tune visible rows per table.
