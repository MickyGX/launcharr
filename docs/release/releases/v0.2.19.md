# Changelog

## [v0.2.19] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- None.

### Changed

- Removed built-in apps now retain a backup of menu, overview, launch mode, and favorite state for later restoration.
- Re-adding a built-in app now restores preserved app configuration instead of forcing reset defaults.

### Fixed

- Fixed remove/re-add regressions where built-in apps lost menu and overview configuration.
- Fixed legacy removed-app recovery paths to restore expected defaults when older backup data is missing.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No data migration required.
- If an app was previously re-added with reset defaults, reconfigure once; future remove/re-add operations now preserve state.
