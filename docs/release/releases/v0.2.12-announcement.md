# Launcharr v0.2.12 Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.12` is now available.

## Short Summary

This release improves reverse-proxy subpath compatibility, unifies overview-card filter UX with dashboard cards, and fixes Jellyfin artwork rendering in recently added cards and modal views.

## What's New

- Added base-path/subpath runtime handling across request routing, redirects, and rendered HTML output.
- Added base-path-aware client patching for `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, and URL-bearing DOM attributes.
- Updated PWA path handling for subpath deployments:
  - `manifest.webmanifest`
  - `public/pwa.js`
  - `public/sw.js`
- Added app-overview filter popover behavior so individual app cards use the same filter-button pattern as dashboard cards.
- Added authenticated Jellyfin image proxy endpoint (`/api/jellyfin/image`) with stronger artwork fallback mapping.
- Updated Jellyfin recent/modal rendering to fall back between poster and backdrop artwork.
- Reduced Plex watchlisted card background hydration requests to improve responsiveness.

## Why It Matters

- Launcharr is more reliable when hosted behind reverse proxies under subpaths.
- Card controls now feel consistent between dashboard and app overview pages.
- Jellyfin recently added cards and modal views show artwork more reliably.
- Lower UI overhead improves responsiveness on heavier overview pages.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.12`
- No schema migration required.
- If hosted under a subpath, set `Settings -> General -> Base URL Path` (for example `/launcharr`).
