# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.33` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.33` adds a new Settings `About` experience, role-based sidebar short/long press actions, and fixes launch/press behavior consistency across dashboard and app/info pages.

## What's New

- Added `Settings -> About` with support links, version context, and recent release list.
- Added `View Changelog` release modal with brief highlights and direct full-release links.
- Added role-based sidebar app-button `Short Press` and `Long Press` actions (`Default`, `Launch`, `App settings`, `Activity`).
- Updated General settings press-action UI to a compact filter-popover layout that is easier to use on mobile.
- Fixed new-tab launch behavior so configured apps reliably open in a new tab from press actions.
- Fixed hidden sidebar-link toggle interactions so configured press actions still route to `App settings` and `Activity`.

## Why It Matters

- Admins can define consistent sidebar interaction behavior per role without forcing submenu usage.
- Users get predictable app launch behavior across dashboard and app/info contexts.
- About/release visibility is now available directly in settings without leaving Launcharr.

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.33`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (no `latest` tag for this release path).
- No migration steps required.
