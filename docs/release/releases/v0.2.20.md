# Changelog

## [v0.2.20] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- None.

### Changed

- Built-in app Settings access is now normalized to admin-only so menu visibility matches route permissions.
- Sidebar menu access checks now require both sidebar visibility and underlying section access before links are shown.

### Fixed

- Fixed legacy removed default-app restoration so submenu role settings are recovered correctly.
- Fixed navigation and access checks so removed apps no longer appear in the sidebar or pass menu-access evaluation.

### Security

- Tightened role enforcement for built-in app settings access to admin-only.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No data migration required.
- If legacy removed built-in apps had inconsistent submenu roles, re-adding them in Settings applies corrected defaults.
