### Added

- Added Jellyfin and Emby support as first-class media apps in dashboard and app overview modules.
- Added multi-instance support for:
  - Radarr
  - Sonarr
  - Bazarr
- Added instance tab UI in app settings for supported apps, with add/delete flows and per-instance naming.
- Added default app management in `Settings -> Custom -> Sidebar` with remove/re-add flow for default apps.
- Added dashboard card management improvements to allow adding/removing dashboard items and combined card variants more flexibly.

### Changed

- Updated combined media and ARR/downloader card configuration UX for clearer source/app selection.
- Updated combined downloader source formatting to match the same selector style used by other combined cards.
- Updated queue/dashboard labels and icon rendering for consistency across single and combined cards.

### Fixed

- Fixed icon mismatches across sidebar manager, dashboard manager, and combined modules.
- Fixed dashboard manager update/remove behavior for several card rows and controls.
- Fixed Prowlarr API key field visibility in both settings entry points.

### Migration Notes

- No schema migration required.
- Re-check dashboard card selections if you previously removed/re-added defaults during the transition.
