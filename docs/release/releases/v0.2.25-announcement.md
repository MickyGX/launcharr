# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.25` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.25` adds local-avatar customization, owner-aware avatar fallbacks, and safer Launcharr-user lifecycle controls with protected delete flows.

## What's New

- Local Launcharr accounts can now upload custom avatars from the user profile page (with validation and preview).
- User-pill avatar fallback now differentiates owner setup admin (`/icons/role.svg`) from other local/system users (`/icons/user-profile.svg`).
- `Settings -> User` now includes local-user delete actions with confirmation and server-enforced protections.
- Mobile handling for the local users table has been tightened to avoid clipping from new controls.

## Why It Matters

- Admins get safer user management without risking owner-account removal.
- Local users get a clearer identity model with configurable avatars and consistent fallback behavior.
- Operators get stronger mobile usability in user-management flows.
