# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.37` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.37` improves Romm login experience for shared/viewer access, unifies app settings UI across both settings pages, and fixes Sidebar Manager default app removal persistence.

## What's New

- Added Romm viewer/admin session test actions in settings (`Test Viewer Session` and `Test Admin Session`) to help validate cookie/session bootstrap behavior before launch.
- Improved Romm shared-account launch flow support (viewer login/cookie priming) for Launcharr `user` / `co-admin` roles while keeping admin launches on main Romm credentials.
- Unified app settings form UI between `App > [App] > Settings` and `Settings > Apps` so fields, notes, and action buttons stay consistent.
- Added container-friendly HTTP access logs plus optional host/IP log redaction for easier troubleshooting in tools like Dozzle.
- Fixed Sidebar Manager built-in/default app removal persistence (including hidden-by-default apps such as `Emby`).

## Why It Matters

- Romm users can launch into a shared viewer account flow more reliably without repeated logins in common setups.
- Admins no longer have to remember which settings page has the “real” version of an app’s settings UI.
- Built-in app cleanup in Sidebar Manager now behaves consistently and stays applied after reload.
- Logs are easier to share safely when troubleshooting remote issues.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.37`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (if selected during release flow).
