# Launcharr v0.2.8 Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.8` is now available.

## Short Summary

This release delivers full role-based visibility controls across Sidebar, Dashboard, and Category managers, plus stability fixes for settings and maximize mode behavior.

## What's New

- Added unified per-app visibility filter controls in `Settings -> Custom -> Sidebar` (Sidebar, Overview, Launch, App settings, Activity).
- Added per-card visibility filters in `Settings -> Custom -> Dashboard`.
- Added per-category visibility filters and default category remove/re-add flow in `Settings -> Custom -> Categories`.
- Added sidebar header quick menu options for starfield toggle and in-browser maximize/minimize layout.
- Fixed manager-page regression and interaction bugs in filter popovers/dropdowns.

## Why It Matters

- Admins can now set clear minimum-role access for navigation and dashboard content without manual toggles.
- Category behavior is more predictable for mixed-role households: restricted categories no longer hide allowed apps entirely.
- Settings pages are more stable and faster to manage during frequent UI customization.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.8`
- Optional tags depending on release path: `development` and/or `latest`
- No schema migration required.
- If using user/group mapping in Docker Compose, use `user: "dockuser:everyone"`.
- Recheck role visibility in Sidebar/Dashboard/Categories after upgrade.
