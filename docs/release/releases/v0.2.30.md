# Changelog

## [v0.2.30] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added default `Indexers` category with icon support (`/icons/indexers.svg`) in category defaults.
- Added `Indexers` to default category ordering and config examples for new installs.

### Changed

- Updated built-in app defaults so `Prowlarr` and `Jackett` now use category `Indexers` by default.
- Updated dashboard card customization in settings so removed sidebar apps no longer contribute app-specific dashboard cards.
- Updated integrations documentation to reflect `Prowlarr` and `Jackett` under the `Indexers` category.

### Fixed

- Fixed instance deletion logic so non-primary instances can still be deleted when the primary instance is missing.
- Fixed instance tab UI in `Settings -> Apps` to show delete controls for first visible non-primary instances.
- Preserved combined cards in dashboard settings unless no active source apps remain for that combined card.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- Existing deployments with explicit category overrides for `Prowlarr`/`Jackett` will keep their current category values until changed.
- No schema/data migration required.
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade to load updated category/icon defaults and settings UI behavior.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] `Indexers` appears in category management with icon `/icons/indexers.svg`
- [ ] New installs/default app entries place `Prowlarr` and `Jackett` under `Indexers`
- [ ] Removing an app from `Settings -> Custom -> Sidebar` removes that app's dashboard cards in `Settings -> Custom -> Dashboard`
- [ ] Combined dashboard cards remain unless no active source app is available
- [ ] Non-primary app instances (for example `qbittorrent-2`) can be deleted from `Settings -> Apps`
