# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.23` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.23` restores Base URL Path configuration and hardens subpath URL handling across integrations, while refining sidebar quick-menu starfield/maximize behavior.

## What's New

- `Base URL Path` is back in `Settings -> General` (for example `/launcharr`).
- Launcharr callback/forward URL generation now applies configured base path for Plex auth flow.
- Integration URL joins now preserve app subpaths like `https://domain.com/radarr` and `https://domain.com/qbittorrent`.
- Starfield quick menu is now state-aware (`Enable/Disable Starfield`) and disabled in mobile/maximized modes, with automatic state restore after minimize.

## Why It Matters

- Admins running reverse-proxy subpath deployments get predictable callback and app routing behavior again.
- Users get clearer quick-menu controls and consistent starfield behavior across view modes.
- Operators get fewer launch/proxy failures caused by path-prefix stripping.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.23`
- No schema/data migration required.
- If Launcharr runs behind a subpath, set `Settings -> General -> Base URL Path` after upgrade.
