# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.38` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.38` is a Romm hotfix release that restores the standard admin launch path while keeping viewer/co-admin shared-session launch support and Romm session test tools.

## What's New

- Reverted automatic Romm admin launch credential injection/bootstrap on the default admin launch path.
- Preserved Romm viewer/co-admin shared viewer login/session bootstrap behavior.
- Kept Romm `Test Admin Session` and `Test Viewer Session` actions for diagnostics and manual session priming.

## Why It Matters

- Romm admin launches now follow the configured launch mode more predictably (including iframe mode) instead of falling back when admin bootstrap fails against a local URL candidate.
- Shared viewer-account launches for non-admin roles remain available.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.38`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (if selected during release flow).
- No migration steps required. Hard refresh browser assets after upgrade.

## Documentation

- Changelog: `docs/release/releases/v0.2.38.md`
- Release timeline: `docs/release/RELEASE_NOTES.md`

## Known Issues

- Romm session bootstrap behavior for viewer/co-admin launches can still vary across browsers/modes (especially PWA/installed app mode, private/incognito mode, or strict mobile privacy settings).
