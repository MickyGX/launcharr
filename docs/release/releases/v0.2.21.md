### Added

- Added expanded dashboard/app-overview module wiring for queue/indexer cards across core integrations.

### Changed

- Updated default-app bootstrap and startup scripts to harden first-run/default catalog initialization.
- Updated queue and indexer rendering flow to use a more consistent table-card behavior model.

- Fixed multiple queue/indexer UI inconsistencies between app overview and dashboard table cards.

### Security

### Deprecated

### Migration Notes
