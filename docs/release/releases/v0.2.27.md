# Changelog

## [v0.2.27] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added richer Seerr request failure diagnostics that include the list of attempted base URLs.

### Changed

- Updated Seerr/Pulsarr request API candidate resolution to prioritize explicit `remoteUrl` and `localUrl` values.
- Updated request-module URL fallback behavior so launch/default fallback URLs are used only when appropriate.

### Fixed

- Fixed Seerr/Overseerr request failures surfacing loopback fallback targets (for example `http://localhost:5055`) when explicit non-loopback URLs were configured.
- Fixed request-module candidate selection to avoid loopback-only fallback candidates when explicit non-loopback URLs are present.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No schema migration required.
- Existing app URL settings remain compatible.
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade to apply updated request URL resolution logic.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] In `Settings -> Apps -> Seerr`, set `localUrl` to a non-loopback host (for example `http://192.168.0.10:5055`) and keep `url` as `http://localhost:5055`
- [ ] Request modules load via configured non-loopback URL instead of loopback fallback
- [ ] Failed Seerr responses include attempted base URLs in the error details
