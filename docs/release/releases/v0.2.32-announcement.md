# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.32` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.32` is a targeted dashboard manager hotfix that resolves `Tautulli -> Watch Statistics` card order not persisting after drag-and-save.

## What's New

- Fixed dashboard row ordering persistence for `Tautulli -> Watch Statistics`.
- Updated dashboard settings row-order assignment so row drag/save uses the dashboard card order field and not nested Tautulli watch-card order fields.

## Why It Matters

- Reordering `Watch Statistics` now behaves consistently with other dashboard cards.
- Prevents card position resets to the bottom after saving dashboard settings.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.32`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (no `latest` tag for this release path).
- No migration steps required.
