# Changelog

## [v0.2.22] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Added dynamic Plex library section-key discovery for Recently Added (`/library/sections`) instead of relying on fixed IDs.
- Added ARR activity-queue per-page controls (`5`, `10`, `25`, `50`) in app overview and dashboard queue cards.

### Changed

- Updated indexer filter popover rendering/layering so long option sets are no longer constrained by the previous capped list behavior.
- Updated queue-table bindings so ARR activity queue limits are wired to shared table pagination state.

### Fixed

- Fixed Plex Recently Added failures for servers where movie/show libraries do not use section IDs `1` and `2`.
- Fixed missing ARR activity-queue page-size options in filter controls.
- Fixed indexer filter popover clipping/stacking regressions over table regions.

### Security

- None.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Migration Notes

- No data migration required.
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade so updated client assets (`plex-overview.js`, overview templates, styles) are served.
