# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.29` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.29` expands Romm integration with richer console/recent cards and detail popups, improves ROM count/stat handling, and adds default/user theme persistence controls.

## What's New

- Romm is now fully integrated as a built-in app with overview cards for `Recently Added` and `Consoles`.
- Console cards now support richer filtering/sorting (`Most ROMs`, `A to Z`, `Z to A`, `Least ROMs`) and an `All` limit.
- Eye-icon popups now show console stats summaries when description text is missing.
- Theme preferences can now be saved as admin defaults and as per-user profile settings.

## Why It Matters

- Romm content is easier to browse and inspect directly from Launcharr without table-heavy views.
- Console library totals and ordering are more trustworthy and actionable.
- Theme customization is now persistent at both system-default and personal profile levels.

- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (no `latest` tag for this release path).
