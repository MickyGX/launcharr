# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.28` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.28` restores Seerr API key field visibility in settings and hardens API-key field detection across supported apps.

## What's New

- Seerr API key field is restored in `Settings -> App`.
- Seerr API key field is restored in the per-app settings page.
- API-key-required app detection now uses explicit base app IDs (including Seerr/Pulsarr) to prevent metadata-driven visibility regressions.

## Why It Matters

- You can configure Seerr credentials directly again without manual config edits.
- Request-module integration setup is more reliable when app categories are customized.
- Field visibility is now consistent across both settings surfaces.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.28`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (no `latest` tag for this release path).
- No schema/data migration required.
- Restart Launcharr after upgrade to apply the settings template updates.
