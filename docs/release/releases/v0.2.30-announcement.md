# Launcharr Release Announcement

## Headline

Launcharr `v0.2.30` is now available

## Short Summary

Launcharr `v0.2.30` introduces a dedicated `Indexers` category for Prowlarr/Jackett, improves dashboard card cleanup when apps are removed, and fixes non-primary instance deletion in settings.

## What's New

- Added a default `Indexers` category with a new category icon (`/icons/indexers.svg`).
- `Prowlarr` and `Jackett` now default to `Indexers` in built-in app defaults.
- Removing apps from sidebar customization now removes their app-specific dashboard cards while preserving valid combined cards.
- Instance deletion handling now supports cleanup of non-primary instances even when the primary instance is absent.

## Why It Matters

- Indexer integrations are grouped more clearly by default for cleaner sidebar/category organization.
- Dashboard customization behavior now aligns with sidebar app removal expectations.
- Admins can recover from instance-order edge cases without editing config files manually.

## Upgrade Notes

- Docker image: `mickygx/launcharr:v0.2.30`
- Supplementary tag: `mickygx/launcharr:development` (no `latest` tag for this release path).
- No schema/data migration required.
- Existing explicit category overrides for `Prowlarr`/`Jackett` are preserved until changed manually.
